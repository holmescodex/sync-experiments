## Connection Summary

- **✅ Working (9 elements)**: Core messaging and network functionality
- **🟡 Partial (3 elements)**: Limited functionality, missing features
- **🔴 Broken (6 elements)**: UI exists but no backend connection

## Critical Issues

### 1. Simulation Controls Not Functional
- Play/pause/speed controls are decorative only
- No backend simulation orchestrator
- Timeline shows past events but no scheduling

### 2. File Attachments Broken
- UI fully prepared for file uploads
- No backend endpoints for file handling
- File preview works but sending fails

### 3. Auto-message Generation Missing
- Frequency controls exist but don't work
- No backend auto-message service
- Timeline lacks "upcoming events"

## Working Features ✅

1. **Real-time Messaging**: Full bidirectional chat with proper styling
2. **Network Simulation**: Complete network control and visualization
3. **Device Statistics**: Live backend stats display
4. **Database Management**: Reset and clear operations work

## Backend Services Status

| Service | Port | Health Check | Purpose | Status |
|---------|------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Alice Backend | 3001 | `/api/health` | Device messages/reactions | ✅ Running |
| Bob Backend | 3002 | `/api/health` | Device messages/reactions | ✅ Running |
| Network Simulator | 3003/3004 | `/api/health` | Network events/config | ✅ Running |
| Simulation Orchestrator | None | N/A | Timeline control | ❌ Missing |
| File Service | None | N/A | File upload/download | ❌ Missing |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix file upload backend endpoints
2. **Short-term**: Build simulation orchestrator for timeline controls
3. **Long-term**: Add WebSocket connections for better performance
